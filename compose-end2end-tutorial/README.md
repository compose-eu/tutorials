Developing an IoT application with COMPOSE: Smart Spaces Use Case Tutorial

This tutorial has the objective of showing and end to end development of a use case application, with tips on how to configure the different features of COMPOSE and how to integrate them. We assume you have read the basic COMPOSE description and architecture and at least played with the basic tutorials! (here:...).

The application we are building in this tutorial is based on a Smart Spaces scenario, where products become an interaction point with consumers to create enhanced experiences. From the functional point of view the application will allow users to:

* Log in into the COMPOSE platform and get access to the application.
* Search for products based on their semantic descriptions.
* Access product information, combining static and dynamic information.
* Access special offers based on their memberships status.
* Provide feedback on products.
* Visualise statistics on products.
